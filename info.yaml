    todo:
        - add unit tests before publishing
        - documentation:
            - add JSDOC stuff
                /**

                */
        - add set date
        - add durations:
            - classes:
                - years
                - months
                - weeks
                - days
                - hours
                - minutes
                - seconds
                - miliseconds
            - methods:
                - convert to any other duration
                - allow adding any duration to any date
                - toString
                - toPrimitive
            - prevent negative constructor times after that

            - set milisecond
            - set second
